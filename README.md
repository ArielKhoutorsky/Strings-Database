# Strings-Database
A database of strings stored based on an assigned id, a length and a starting index.

A set of strings are stored in memory. The memory array is composed of characters, that of the stored strings. We also store String objects in a linked list, each object representing where the string is stored in the array of characters with an assigned id, a length and a starting index. We have methods that get the desired strings and that remove them and put them in memory.
